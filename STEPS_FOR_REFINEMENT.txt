We have template ct scan and a target ct scan
we segment the ventricles of the template ct scan
we segment the midline of the template ct scan
we register the template ct scan to the target ct scan and get the transformation matrix
we apply the same transformation matrix to the ventrilce mask and the midline mask
Get the extent of the transformed ventricles with a bounding box
apply that bounding box to get the upper part of the brain and also separate the ventricular from the sulcal csf
